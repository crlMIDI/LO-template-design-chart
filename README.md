Idea for user-friendly LO Writer template design

LO have invited users to submit templates for Writer. Making adaptable
templates is difficult, for reasons explained in the first worksheet of the
LO Calc file.

The file is an attempt at a user-friendly approach.
Parameters are presented in tabular form, with all heading levels (for
example) in a single table. Font settings and vertical spacings are re-scaled
automatically when the font size is changed.

It should be possible to make a live demo by exporting the spreadsheet values
to a template xml file via CSV, though that would not provide interactivity.
